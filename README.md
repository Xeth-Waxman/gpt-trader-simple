# gpt-trader-simple
A simple trading application, written by ChatGPT. The rules:
1. ChatGPT must write all the code. 
2. When the code has errors, ChatGPT must be the one to correct the errors.
3. I can supply the error messages to ChatGPT, but I can't provide hints as to what might be wrong with the code. I am acting like a complete non-programmer.

# The initial prompt:
> I would like to create a python application that uses the Alpha Vantage TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED API to collect stock data for a selected stock, and then generate a buy or sell signal based on trading strategies.
